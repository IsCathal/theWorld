## Overview

**theWorld** is an Electron application that embeds a React frontend. The React portion is bundled via Create React App, and Electron provides a native desktop container. This project features a simple chatbot UI and can be easily extended or customized.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A supported **OS** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/theWorld.git
   cd theWorld
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Usage

### Development Mode

In development, the React app runs on a local dev server (port 3000 by default), and Electron automatically loads that URL.

**Start the App:**
```bash
npm start
```

**What Happens:**  
- `npm start` runs both `react-scripts start` (the React dev server) and Electron in parallel.  
- You should see an Electron window open, displaying your React app.

### Production Build

When you’re ready to create a production version of the React app and run it in Electron without the dev server:

**Build the React App:**
```bash
npm run build-react
```
This generates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

**Launch Electron:**
```bash
npm run package
```
This script runs the build first (if needed) and then opens Electron pointing to the built files.

*(Note: This script does not create an installer. To generate distributable installers for Windows, macOS, or Linux, you can integrate tools like `electron-builder`.)*

---

**Test:**
- **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework that comes preconfigured with Create React App.

```bash
npm test
```

## Project Structure
